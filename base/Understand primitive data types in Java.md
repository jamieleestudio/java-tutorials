Data types are cornerstones of a programming language. The Java language has 8 primitive types: boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, and short.

A boolean type represents either true or false value.

A char type represents a single character, such as 'a', 'B', 'c', ...Actually char type is 16-bit integer number (un-signed).

The others are numeric types. The following section lists the primitive types which represent numbers in the Java language (the char type is also included because it is actually a number type):

# Integer numbers:

byte: 8 bit (1 byte)
* minimum value: -128 (-2^7)
* maximum value: 127 (2^7-1)

char: 16 bit (2 bytes)
* minimum value: 0
* maximum value: 65,535

short: 16 bit (2 bytes)
* minimum value: -32,768 (-2^15)
* maximum value: 32,767 (2^15-1)

int: 32 bit (4 bytes)
* minimum value:  -2,147,483,648 (-2^31)
* maximum value: 2,147,483,647 (2^31-1)

long: 64 bit (8 bytes)
* minimum value:  approx. -9,2 billions of billion (-2^63)
* maximum value:  approx. 9,2 billions of billion (2^63-1)



# Floating-point numbers:

* float: 32 bit (4 bytes):
* double: 64 bit (8 bytes):
